I am an agronomic data scientist and product strategist with proven success in commercializing deep technologies for digital agriculture.

I have experience in designing and launching both products and go-to-market strategies, developing digital agriculture products leveraging geospatial, imagery, and IoT data, managing complex research and development projects, and enabling consultative technical sales.

My academic research is focused on investigating nitrogen and irrigation management strategies to improve agronomic efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, particularly for potato production, to protect water resources, mitigate climate change, and improve farmer profitability.

I find fulfillment in learning new things, communicating complex ideas, supporting others through inclusion and personal development, and dedicating myself to projects I am passionate about.
