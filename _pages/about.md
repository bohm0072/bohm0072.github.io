I am an agronomic data scientist and go-to-market strategist with proven success in commercializing deep technology products for digital agriculture.

I have experience in designing and launching go-to-market and product strategies, developing digital agriculture products leveraging geospatial, imagery, and IoT data, managing complex research and development projects, and inventing precision agriculture technologies.

My academic research is focused on investigating nitrogen and irrigation management strategies to improve agronomic efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, particularly for potato production, to protect water resources, mitigate climate change, and improve farmer profitability.

I find fulfillment in learning new things, communicating complex ideas, supporting others through inclusion and personal development, and dedicating myself to projects I am passionate about.
