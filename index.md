I am a data scientist focused on developing precision agriculture technologies and products for data-driven agronomic decision making, using geospatial data including remote sensing imagery and IoT sensors.

My academic research is focused on improving in-season nitrogen and irrigation management in potato production and investigating approaches to improve nitrogen use efficiency.

I am broadly interested in protecting water resources, addressing climate change, and improving grower profitability through education, engagement, and entrepreneurship. I find fulfillment in learning new things, communicating complex ideas, supporting others through inclusion and personal development, and dedicating myself to projects I am passionate about.
